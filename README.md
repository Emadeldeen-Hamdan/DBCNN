# DBCNN

This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Dual-Branch Complex Neural Network (DBCNN) proposed in the manuscript:

**“Real-time Instantaneous Phase Estimation Using a Deep Dual-Branch Complex Neural Network”**,  
submitted to *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering* (TBME).

The repository is provided to support reproducibility and transparency.  
The complete training and evaluation pipeline will be released upon final acceptance.
